\section{Bugs, Suggestions, Feature requests}
If you encounter bugs, have suggestions or have a feature request, then please go to the issue page open a new issue if necessary and explain your concern. You can also write us an email (ichbinkeinreh at t-online.de or jens.dittrich at cs.uni-saarland.de).

\section{Abstract}
PDBF documents are a hybrid format. They are a valid PDF and a valid HTML page at the same time. You can now optionally add an VirtualBox OVA file with a complete operating system to the PDBF document. Yes, this means that the resulting file is a valid PDF, HTML, and OVA file at the same time. If you change the file extension to PDF and open it with an PDF viewer, you can see the static part of the document. If you change the file extension to HTML and open it with a Browser (currently Chrome/Firefox/Safari/IE 10 supported), you can see the dynamic part of the document. And if an ova file is attached you can also change the file extension to OVA and install and run the attached operating system.\\
The difference between the PDF and the HTML version is that the PDF version contains static version of all PDBF elements, whereas the HTML version is dynamic. For example you can zoom into graphs, temporarly remove dataseries from the graph, inspect and change the underling query of the PDBF element and see the result of the change directly in the browser.\\
This approach works completely offline. No internet connection is required, neither at compile time, nor at viewing time.

\noindent PDBF files are created from LaTeX source code and a relational database. The raw data can either be a SQL statement string, a file with SQL statements, or contained in a database (currently PostgreSQL/MySQL/MariaDB supported). In the LaTeX code you can then specify how the PDBF element (currently charts/pivot tables/multiplot charts/sql statements/dataTexts/dataTables are supported) is created from the raw data with options and an SQL query. Read more in the \href{http://uds-datalab.github.io/PDBF/}{documentation}, which is itself is a PDBF document.\\

\noindent PDBF toolkit is written in Java and LaTeX and can be used to compile documents on Windows, Mac, and Linux. PDBF documents are also platform independent and run on any desktop OS (Windows, Linux, Mac) with a browser/PDF viewer.\\

\section{Getting started}
\subsection{Normal usage}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure you have a Java Runtime (version $>=$ 1.7) and a LaTeX distribution installed
\item \href{https://github.com/uds-datalab/PDBF/archive/gh-pages.zip}{Download the latest version}
\item Extract zip and change workingdir to extracted folder
\item Adjust config.cfg
\item Try to compile minimal.tex file with this command: \texttt{java -jar pdbf.jar minimal.tex}
\item Open minimal.html, this is the final output of the compilation process, if you rename it to ".pdf" it is also a valid pdf-document
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Attach a VirtualBox image}
\begin{itemize}
\item Optionally you can attach the included vldb-Invaders.ova (Space invaders clone) or \href{https://github.com/uds-datalab/PDBF/releases/download/1.0.1/dsl.ova}{download the dsl.ova} (Damn small linux) VirtualBox image and attach it to the compiled PDBF file with this command: \texttt{java -jar pdbf.jar --vm minimal.html vldb-Invaders.ova}.
\item Open minimal.ova, this is the final output with the attached ova file. Its still a valid pdf and html file at the same time.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Attach a tar archive}
\begin{itemize}
\item Optionally you can attach a tar archive file to the compiled PDBF file with this command: \texttt{java -jar pdbf.jar --tar minimal.html TAR\_file.tar}
\item Open minimal.tar, this is the final output with the attached tar file. Its still a valid pdf and html file at the same time.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Learn how to use the PDBF framework}
\begin{itemize}
\item You can play around with the minimal.tex file. It contains a small example on how to specify PDBF elements in LaTeX
\item For further information take a look at the \href{http://uds-datalab.github.io/PDBF/}{documentation}
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}
\subsection{Automatic generation of Charts, Multiplot Charts, Pivot tables}
With PDBF you don't need to manually generate these kinds of elements. The PDBF compiler automatically generates a static version for the pdf and the dynamic version for the html part of the PDBF document. This also means that your document is always up to date! If you change something in the underlying data that generate your PDBF document and then recompile the document, then the data in the document is up to date. No need to manually update externally generated charts or pivot tables.

\subsection{Generate your document directly from the results of your experiment}
The idea of PDBF is to store the results of the experiment directly in the document and to make it more transparent how this chart, pivot table, etc. was generated from the result data. Therefore we currently support CSV files, SQL files, and SQL servers as data sources and use SQL as description language for the transformation of the raw result data to the final representation in the document.

\subsection{Compile LaTeX to single HTML file}
You can also use the PDBF compiler to compile your LaTeX files to a single HTML file.
To do so just run the compiler as on any other document (you dont need to include the pdbf package in your tex file):\\[3pt]
\texttt{java -jar pdbf.jar sometexfile.tex}\\[3pt]
The resulting HTML file is saved in the same folder with the same name but with ".html" filename extension.

\section{Build Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Run "mvn package" if you only want to compile pdbf.jar
\item Run "mvn verify" if you want to compile pdbf.jar and run integration tests.
\end{itemize}

\section{How to use the PDBF compiler}
Right now there are only three modes: \\[4pt]
-- The standart mode which compiles a tex file into the janiform PDBF format:\\
\verb|java -jar PDBF.jar LaTeX_file| \\[2pt]
\textbf{Note:} The compiled document can be found in the same folder as the tex file and has the same name as the tex file but ".html" as filename extension.\\[8pt]
-- The VM mode which attaches a VirtualBox .ova file to an existing PDBF document:\\
\verb|java -jar PDBF.jar --vm PDBF_File.html VM_File.ova|\\[2pt]
\textbf{Note:} Currently there is a hard size limit of 1.9GB for .ova files!
\textbf{Note:} The compiled document can be found in the same folder as the html file and has the same name as the html file but ".ova" as filename extension.\\[8pt]
-- The TAR mode which attaches a tar archive file to an existing PDBF document:\\
\verb|java -jar PDBF.jar --tar PDBF_File.html TAR_File.tar|\\[2pt]
\textbf{Note:} The compiled document can be found in the same folder as the html file and has the same name as the html file but ".tar" as filename extension.
\textbf{Note:} Currently there is a hard size limit of 1.9GB for .tar files!

\section{Requirements}
The following \LaTeX~packages are required for PDBF documents:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|zref|
\item \verb|xcolor|
\item \verb|graphicx|
\item \verb|xstring|
\item \verb|xparse|
\item \verb|geometry|
\item \verb|array|
\end{itemize}
\noindent Furthermore it is needed that your \LaTeX~document uses the geometry package to specify the page size.\\

\noindent \textbf{Warning:} There are problems with \textbf{inputenc} and \textbf{pgfpages} package. If you really have to use the inputenc package with UTF8 option then you cant use non-ASCII characters inside queries. The pgfpages package is currently incompatible to this package. 

\section{SQL specifics and special functions}
PDBF uses AlaSQL as database engine. For all available features of the database visit \url{https://github.com/agershun/alasql}. Some functionality might not yet be available because we currently don't use the latest version.\\[4pt]
\textbf{Note:} Mostly sql syntax is standart sql, but for example attributes with spaces in their name have to be sourrounded by square brackets. E.g. SELECT attribute AS [attribute with spaces] FROM test;\\

\noindent We extended AlaSQL with the following statistical sql functions:\\[5pt]
\verb|GRUBBS_FILTER(arr, alpha, max)|: \\

\subsection{SQL}
Clickable SQL-statements\\[3pt]
\textbf{Note:} Currently SQL is limited to one line of text. No line breaks are possible.\\
Example:\\[3pt]
\sql{SELECT * FROM test;}\\[3pt]
%
\noindent Macros: \\[3pt]
\verb|\sql[options][textForPage]{queryForOverlay}| \\
\textbf{Note:} if \verb|textForPage| is omitted the \verb|queryForOverlay| is used as text for the page.\\[8pt]

\noindent Options: \\[3pt]

\option
{color}
{The textcolor of the displayed text.}
{\texttt{white}, \texttt{black}, \texttt{red}, \texttt{green}, \texttt{blue}, \texttt{cyan}, \texttt{magenta}, \texttt{yellow} or xcolor syntax (see \href{http://mirror.unicorncloud.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/xcolor/xcolor.pdf}{here}). Can also be redefined globally (\texttt{pdbfDynamicTextColor})}
{\texttt{blue}}

\subsection{DataText}
Write text that is the result of a SQL-statement.\\
\textbf{Note:} Currently DataText is limited to one line of text. No line breaks are possible.\\
\textbf{Note:} DataText can be linked to other PDBF elements (Currently only charts supported). This means that if you move the mouse over this DataText then the specified data in the linked PDBF element is highlighted.\\[3pt]
Example:\\[3pt]
The table ``test'' contains \dataText{SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;} tuples.\\
The table ``test'' contains the following tuples: \dataText{SELECT * FROM test;}.\\[3pt]
%
\noindent Macros: \\[3pt]
\verb|\dataText[options]{query}| \\[8pt]

\noindent Options: \\[3pt]

\option
{color}
{The textcolor of the displayed text.}
{\texttt{white}, \texttt{black}, \texttt{red}, \texttt{green}, \texttt{blue}, \texttt{cyan}, \texttt{magenta}, \texttt{yellow} or xcolor syntax (see \href{http://mirror.unicorncloud.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/xcolor/xcolor.pdf}{here}). Can also be redefined globally (\texttt{pdbfDynamicTextColor})}
{\texttt{blue}}

\option
{linkTo}
{When this option is set then this DataText and the element with name equal to the value of \texttt{linkTo} are linked. When the cursor is moved above the DataText then in the linked element the specified \texttt{linkSelector} specifies which part of the element is highlighted and annotated with the value of \texttt{linkLabel}.}
{String which value is the name of some other element. \textbf{Currently only chart elements can be used for \texttt{linkTo}.}}
{\texttt{undefined}}

\option
{linkSelector}
{The selector that specifies which part of the \texttt{linkTo} element is highlighted.}
{\texttt{Number}, \texttt{Date} or \texttt{String} depending on the type of the \texttt{linkTo} element. For charts the type depends on the datatype of the xAxis and the value specifies which part of the xAxis is highlighted.}
{\texttt{undefined}}

\option
{linkLabel}
{The text that is displayed near the highlighted area.}
{String}
{\texttt{undefined}}

\subsection{DataTable}
Write a \LaTeX\space table that is the result of a SQL-statement.\\[3pt]
Example:\\[3pt]
\dataTable{SELECT * FROM test;}\\[5pt]
%
\noindent Macros: \\[3pt]
\verb|\dataTable[options]{query}| \\[8pt]

\noindent Options: \\[3pt]

\option
{color}
{The textcolor of the displayed text.}
{\texttt{white}, \texttt{black}, \texttt{red}, \texttt{green}, \texttt{blue}, \texttt{cyan}, \texttt{magenta}, \texttt{yellow} or xcolor syntax (see \href{http://mirror.unicorncloud.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/xcolor/xcolor.pdf}{here}). Can also be redefined globally (\texttt{pdbfDynamicTextColor})}
{\texttt{blue}}

\option
{verticalLines}
{Specifies the vertical lines for the table.}
{\texttt{a} for all, \texttt{i} for inner, \texttt{o} for outer, \texttt{n} for none, or you can use the default tabular syntax (e.g. \texttt{|l|c|r|})}
{\texttt{a}}

\option
{horizontalLinesHeader}
{Specifies the horizontal lines for the table header.}
{\texttt{a} for all, \texttt{i} for inner, \texttt{o} for outer, \texttt{n} for none, or you can specify a custom pattern that is repeatedly applied with the following format: h means line, b means no line, the space character delimits format specifiers. E.g. ``hh b'' means: double line followed by no line followed by double line followed by no line ... and so on}
{\texttt{a}}

\option
{horizontalLinesBody}
{Specifies the horizontal lines for the table body, excluding the border above the first tuple, which is controlled by horizontalLinesHeader.}
{\texttt{a} for all, \texttt{i} for inner, \texttt{o} for outer, \texttt{n} for none, or you can specify a custom pattern that is repeatedly applied with the following format: h means line, b means no line, the space character delimits format specifiers. E.g. ``hh b'' means: double line followed by no line followed by double line followed by no line ... and so on}

\section{F.A.Q.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Q.: The overlay is not on the right position!\\
A.: Most likely you use pages with different sizes in your document or you use the pgfpages package. This is currently not supported by PBDF 
\item Q.: I get \verb|Error: paperwidth value missing! Did you forgot to specify the| \\ \verb|papersize via the geometry package?| when compiling my document.\\
A.: You need to explicitly specify the papersize of your document via the geometry package (e.g. \verb|\usepackage[letterpaper]{geometry}|)
\item Q.: I get \verb|\unhbox \voidb@x \bgroup \let \unhbox \voidb@x \setbox \@tempboxa \hbox| \verb|{u\global \mathchardef \accent@spacefactor \spacefactor }\accent 127 u\egroup| \newline \verb|\spacefactor \accent@spacefactor| or a similar string in a error message.\\
A.: Chances are high that you use the \verb|\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}| package or a similar package. These are not fully compatible with PDBF. If you really have to use the utf8 package then you cant use special characters inside options and queries of the PDBF package.\\
\item Q.: I get strange errors when running "maven verify".\\
A.: If you are using TexLive 2014 or earlier and get the following errors when running "maven verify":
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
The file is not valid, error(s) :
1.2.1 : Body Syntax error, Single space expected [offset=2786901; key=2786901; line=5 0 obj <<; object=COSObject{5, 0}]

\end{lstlisting}
Then you can safely ignore them. They are non critical errors. You can get rid of these errors by upgrading to TexLive 2015 or later.
